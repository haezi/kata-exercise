# Roman Numerals Kata
Simon Dietschi, Micha Harzbecker

## Exercise 1 - Coding Kata

Our goal is to learn a new programming language. We both never used Ruby so we code the following kata in Ruby and use the Jetbrains IDE "RubyMine".

## Exercise 2 - Reflection

- Did we achieve the goal set for the Coding Kata? 
Indeed we did learn a lot about Ruby so the answer is yes.

- What did we do well? 


- What could we have done better? 
We could have used an online ruby environment from the start. At some point of the project trying to run local we switched to cyber-dojo.org.

- What would we do differently, assuming we had to perform the same Kata again?
We would do the kata with more than just 2 people. At the begin of the project we would think about the logic, about special cases of the roman numbers and even write that down as text or on a piece of paper. As result we think that we have a better understanding of how to start coding the logic.

- What did we learn that we can apply in our daily working life?
